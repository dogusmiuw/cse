Assume for simplicity that n is odd and k is even. If the set S was in sorted
order, the median is in position n/2 and the k numbers in S that closest to the median
are in positions (n − k)/2 through (n + k)/2. We first use linear time selection to find
the (n − k)/2, n/2, and (n + k)/2 elements and then pass through the set S to find the
numbers less than (n+k)/2 element, greater than the (n−k)/2 element, and not equal to
the n/2 element. The algorithm takes O(n) time as we use linear time selection exactly
three times and traverse the n numbers in S once.
