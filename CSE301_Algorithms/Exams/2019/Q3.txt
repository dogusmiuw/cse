Solution: Modify the Partition procedure of Quicksort to use the Select algorithm
to choose the median of the input array as the pivot element. The worst-case running
time of Select is linear, so we do not increase the time requirement of Partition, and
selecting the median as pivot guarantees the input is split into two equal parts, so that
we always have the best-case partitioning. The running time of the entire computation is
then given by the recurrence T(n)=2 T(n/2) + O(n) = O(n lg n).

we can achieve O(nLogn) worst case. The idea is based on the fact that the median element of 
an unsorted array can be found in linear time. So we find the median first, then partition the
array around the median element.
