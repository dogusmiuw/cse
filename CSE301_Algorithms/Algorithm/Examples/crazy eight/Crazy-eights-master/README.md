# Crazy eights
Crazy eights is a card game and the rules can be found at https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crazy_Eights
This program is a two-player game (the second player is a dealer). The dealer play follows some simplified logic and may not exactly represent how in reality he/she would play.

Anyway, here is a short description of the rules:

Eight cards are dealt to each player (or seven in a two-player game).[4] The remaining cards of the deck are placed face down at the center of the table. The top card is then turned face up to start the game.

Players discard by matching rank or suit with the top card of the discard pile, starting with the player left of the dealer. They can also play any 8 at any time. If a player is unable to match the rank or suit of the top card of the discard pile and does not have an 8, they draw cards from the stockpile until they get a playable card. When a player plays an 8, they must declare the suit that the next player is to play; that player must then follow the named suit or play another 8.

As an example: Once 6â™£ is played the next player:

    can play any of the other 6s
    can play any of the clubs
    can play any 8 (then must declare a suit)
    can draw from the stockpile until willing and able to play one of the above

The game ends as soon as one player has emptied their hand. That player collects a payment from each opponent equal to the point score of the cards remaining in that opponent's hand. 8s score 50, court cards 10 and all other cards face value.
