* These complexities don't relate to each other.
  Theoretical complexity function (n) is an increasing function
  whereas practical complexity function is not an increasing function.
  If we inspect the practical complexity function's graph, y value(in miliseconds) 
  decreases as the sample size increases from 20K to 30K and 40K to 50K and 
  60K to 70K and 80K to 90K.
