### Command Line
A _command line_ is a text-based interface that is used to input instructions to a computer system.

### Bash
Command line interpreter.

The `bash` shell is an improved version of the original `Bourne Shell` (`sh`) on UNIX systems.

The shell displays a string when it is waiting for user input, called the _shell prompt_. When a regular user starts a shell, the prompt includes an ending dollar (`$`) character:

```bash
[user@host ~]$
```

If the $ sign is #, then its the super user, _root_.
